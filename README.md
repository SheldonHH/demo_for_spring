### Soultion: `sudo lsof -i tcp:5432`

Well, they are just different data formats. Which one's nicer and easier to read? 
That's obviously subjective. Here's a useful blog post.

As far as spring-boot configuration is concerned, 
note that there's only one documented shortcoming of using YAML. Per the documentation:
YAML files canâ€™t be loaded via the @PropertySource annotation. 
So in the case that you need to load values that way,
you need to use a properties file.


As per my knowledge, these are at least some of the differences:

1. .properties stores data in sequential format, whereas
.yml stores data in hierarchical format.
2 .properties supports only key-value pairs (basically string values), whereas
.yml supports key-value pair, as well as map, list & scalar type values.
3 .properties is specifically used by Java, whereas
.yml can be used by other languages (eg Java, Python, ROR, etc).
4 When managing multiple configuration profiles, then:
.properties requires you to create .properties file per every profile, whereas in
.yml you can create a section for each specific profile inside a single .yml file.
2. In Spring projects, @PropertySource annotation can only be used with .properties.
